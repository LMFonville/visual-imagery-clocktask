# Brief description
A cognitive experiment looking at mental imagery using images of clocks. This experiment can run with a Tobii eyetracker to acquire eyegaze data on each trial. Reaction time and accuracy are also recorded.

# Imagery Clock Task
This experiment shows participants images of clocks - analog or digital - with fixation cross trials in between. Every other couple of trials participants are instead asked to produce a mental image of the last clock they saw onto the screen. There are follow-up trials where they are shown an image of a clock that may or may not be the same. During recognition trials they simply have to respond YES or NO if the clock shown is the same as the one they had to imagine. During angle trials (only for analog clocks) they have to respond YES or NO to whether or not the angle that the hour and minute hands make on the clock shown is the same as the one they had to imagine. During time trials (only for digital clocks) they are asked if the clock shown represents the same time as the one they had to imagine.
